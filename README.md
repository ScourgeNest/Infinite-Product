# Infinite Product
 - Vector Mathematics: Perform algebraic calculations for N vector pairs, including dot product and L2 norms.
 - Base 8 Operations: Process N vector pairs exclusively in base 8, computing dot products and second maxima.
 - Mathematical Tasks: Calculate dot products, find second maxima (if available), and L2 norms for N vectors.
